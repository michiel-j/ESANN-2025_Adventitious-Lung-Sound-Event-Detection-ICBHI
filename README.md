# Exploring Model Architectures for Real-Time Lung Sound Event Detection (ESANN 2025)
Code for the publication "*Exploring Model Architectures for Real-Time Lung Sound Event Detection*" by Michiel Jacobs, Lode Vuegen, Tom Verresen, Marie Schouterden, David Ruttens & Peter Karsmakers, which was presented at [European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN)](https://www.esann.org/) (April 2025).

This work was built starting from the work ["*Patch-Mix Contrastive Learning with Audio Spectrogram Transformer on Respiratory Sound Classification*"](https://github.com/raymin0223/patch-mix_contrastive_learning) by Sangmin Bae, June-Woo Kim, Won-Yang Cho, et al (Interspeech 2023).

## Data: ICBHI 2017
Get the ICBHI 2017 lung sound dataset through [https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/](https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/).
TBD (how and where should this data be saved)

## Running The Code
TBD (Conda venv requirements).

## Training Models
TBD (bash script, make file).
